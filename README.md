# Udagram-On-AWS

Instgram alternative to be deployed on AWS as the project of 'Full Stack Apps on AWS' chapter in 'Advanced Cloud Developer' nanodegree on Udacity.

- Prerequisites:

    - Installing Node and NPM
        This project depends on Node.js and Node Package Manager (NPM). Before continuing, you must download and install Node (NPM is included) from https://nodejs.com/en/download.

    - Installing Ionic CLI
        The Ionic Command Line Interface is required to serve and build the frontend. Instructions for installing the CLI can be found in the Ionic Framework Docs.

    - Installing Python3
        Python is a powerful programming language used for anything from quick scripts through data science. We'll use Python for the final project and it is required for some development tools like the AWS CLI. Instructions to download and install Python for your OS can be found here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

    - Amazon Web Services (AWS)
        - Account Setup
            We'll be provisioning cloud resources throughout the next few lessons. You'll need an AWS account to set up these resources. We'll be taking advantage of the free tier offerings so there should be no costs to set up the resources we'll be using. Create a new account here: https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/

        - AWS CLI
            We'll interface with AWS using the Command Line Interface (CLI). Instructions to download and install the AWS CLI for your OS can be found here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html

    - Installing useful tools
        - Postbird
            Postbird is a useful client GUI (graphical user interface) to interact with our provisioned Postgres database. We can establish a remote connection and complete actions like viewing data and changing the schema (tables, columns, ect).

        - Postman
            Postman is a useful tool to issue and save requests. Postman can create GET, PUT, POST, etc. requests complete with bodies. It can also be used to test endpoints automatically. We've included a collection in the starter code repository (./udacity-c2-restapi.postman_collection.json) which contains example requests.
